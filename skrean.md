# Feature Extraction:
The `sklearn.feature_extraction` module can be used to extract features in a format supported by machine learning algorithms from datasets consisting of formats such as text and image.
**Feature extraction from raw data**:
- DictVectorizer
- FeatureHasher
**From images**:
- image.PatchExtractor
- image.extract_patches_2d
- image.grid_to_graph
- image.img_to_graph
- image.reconstruct_from_patches_2d
**From text**:
- text.CountVectorizer
- text.HashingVectorizer
- text.TfidfTransformer
- text.TfidfVectorizer
